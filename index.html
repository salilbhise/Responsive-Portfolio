      <p><strong>/sko͞ol/:</strong> Having managed SaaS projects in Los Angeles's tech/startup scene for the past 8 years, I'm inspired to jump into the world of coding. I'm studying Full-Stack Web Development at the Houston Coding Bootcamp presented by the University of Texas at Austin. Man, coding is tough stuff! I plan on working hard towards my goal, and graduating in January 2019.</p>

      <p><strong>/wərk/:</strong> I currently work at DocResponse as a Customer Success and Sales Specialist. Our solution is an automated assessment and documentation tool that uses patient-entered data to allow medical providers to increase patient throughput, increase billing accuracy and reduce documentation time.</p>

      <p><strong>/līf/:</strong> When I'm not staring at a screen all day or traveling for work, I enjoy hiking, concerts and festivals, comedy shows, Houston sports, and discovering new insta-worthy food around town.</p>
