      <p>Thanks for dropping by. I'm Salil. After spending the better part of a decade managing SaaS projects in Silicon Beach, I've decided to jump into the world of coding. I'm studying Full-Stack Web Development at the Houston Coding Bootcamp presented by the University of Texas at Austin. Man, coding is tough stuff! I plan on working hard towards my goal, and graduating in January 2019.</p>

      <p>I currently work at DocResponse as a Customer Success and Sales Specialist. Our solution is essentially an automated assessment and documentation tool that uses patient-entered data to allow medical providers to increase patient throughput, increase billing accuracy and reduce documentation time.</p>

      <p>When I'm not staring at a screen all day or traveling for work, I enjoy hiking, concerts, comedy shows, and tasty treats.</p>
